### Installing Ruby
Mac install be default, has a ruby install. This is installed in a folder that is root/admin owned. Need to install a ruby manager to install a client/user copy

* Install ruby version manager `brew install rbenv`
* Install Ruby `rbenv install 2.3.0`
* Initialize the Ruby Version `rbenv init`
    * init may tell you to add something to .bash_profile
        * `sudo vi .bash_profile`
        * add the `eval "$(rbenv init -)"` command
        * save and exit (esc wq enter)
        * May have to restart console at this point
* Check the ruby manager to make sure proper version is running `rbenv local`
    * If needed, change the version 'rbenv local 2.3.0`
* Check ruby version `ruby -v`. double check you are pointing at the correct ruby. `which ruby` can be useful as well
* Check path to where ruby gems are stored `gem env home`. This can be useful if you are having permission issues installing gems. by using rbenv, the directory is most likely in the users home folder
